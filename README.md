## Goal

The goal of a GitHub Copilot Hackaton is to learn how to use it.

GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered code assistant that helps developers write better code faster. It uses machine learning models trained on billions of lines of code to suggest whole lines or entire functions based on the context of what youâ€™re working on. By using Copilot, you can learn how to write better code and improve your productivity.

Remember:

- As you type GitHub Copilot will make suggestions, you can accept them by pressing Tab.
- If nothing shows up after Copilot write some lines , press enter and wait a couple of seconds.


## Start the hack

The Environment is already configured & you just need to open the code in Github Codespaces - the green button that says "CODE". You might be asked to log into your GH acount. Then just sit back, wait 2-4minutes until the your development environment is set up and then choose the language you feel most familiar with or you want to be challenged by. 

The challenges are available in:
- .net
- java
- node
